Bu dil C ve C++'dan birçok sözdizim türetmesine rağmen bu türevler daha basit nesne modeli ve daha az düşük seviye olanaklar içerir. Java uygulamaları bilgisayar mimarisine bağlı olmadan herhangi bir Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'de çalışabilen tipik bytecode'dur (sınıf dosyası).\r\n\r\nJava ilk çıktığında daha çok küçük cihazlarda kullanılmak için tasarlanmış ortak bir düzlem dili olarak düşünülmüştü. Ancak düzlem bağımsızlığı özelliği ve tekbiçim kütüphane desteği C ve C++'tan çok daha üstün ve güvenli bir yazılım geliştirme ve işletme ortamı sunduğundan, hemen her yerde kullanılmaya başlanmıştır. Şu anda özellikle kurumsal alanda ve mobil cihazlarda son derece popüler olan Java özellikle J2SE 1.4 ve 5 sürümü ile masaüstü uygulamalarda da yaygınlaşmaya başlamıştır. Java'nin ilk sürümü olan Java 1.0 (1995) Java Platform 1 olarak adlandırıldı ve tasarlama amacına uygun olarak küçük boyutlu ve kısıtlı özelliklere sahipti. Daha sonra düzlemin gücü gözlendi ve tasarımında büyük değişiklikler ve eklemeler yapıldı. Bu büyük değişikliklerden dolayı geliştirilen yeni düzleme Java Platform 2 adı verildi ama sürüm numarası 2 yapılmadı, 1.2 olarak devam etti. 2004 sonbaharında çıkan Java 5, geçmiş 1.2, 1.3 ve 1.4 sürümlerinin ardından en çok gelişme ve değişikliği barındıran sürüm oldu. Java SE 7 ise (kod adı Dolphin) Sun'un üzerinde çalıştığı, Java teknolojisinin günümüz sürümüdür. 13 Kasım 2006'da Java düzlemi GPL ruhsatıyla açık kodlu hale gelmiştir."}, "commit"=>"Update Post", "id"=>"3"}
